## Prompt Used
Below is the complete prompts I used during the coding interation:

```markdown
### Goal
adjust some visual change to this project, re-arrange the components and revise the flow.
1. the current visual design looks good, but it still different what we want
2. the very basic blueprint of the ideal structure can be seen from the pictures I attached

#### Ideal Structure
1. The `main` page can be seen as @wireframe_user1.jpg .
2. The `detail` page can be seen as @wireframe_user3.png 
##### top
1. the lefttop is the logo, then at the same line are four options: `Map`, `Search`, `About Us`, `Register`.
2. the first option `Map` should jump to the position of the map in the same page, so a hash-based url jump is enough.
3. the `Search` option will open a new page (we will need another html file for this), that page we will show a filter bar and filtered results. See: @wireframe_user2.png 
4. the `About Us` option will open another new simple page, which contains the basic information about our "company", you can just put some placeholder or mocked data. See: @wireframe_user4.png 
5. the `Register` page can be leave as placeholder link only, as it is out of scope for our tasks.
6. the topright should be an avatar-like component, logged-in user can see their icon and name.

##### hero section
for the hero section we just need a big picture which can fit to the whole width and a large height.

##### showcase section
below the hero section will be a showcase section, contains 5 recommended artwork, basically 5 components with image and simple text. Clickable and jump to detail page.


##### interactive map section
below will be where we use `leaflet` map, take full width and fully interactive. the pin-point on map will be able to lead user to detail page.

##### Footer
use the current footer is enough

### Current status
the current page looks well-designed, but components are mixed, not align with out thought.
All codes can be found in @homePage/ 


### Context
1. This is a simple HTML+CSS+JS project. The only library this project using is `leaflet` map.
2. For a new page, we can create a new html file.
3. Feel free to open the html (in browser with `playwright` or just look at the code) to see the current status of the pages.
4. Use `context7` to get up-to-date documentation about `leaflet`.
5. Feel free to re-use existing UI components and styles.
6. This project contains several mocked resources, the images can be found under @assets/  .


### Constrains
1. we can only use HTML, css, `leaflet` and plain javascript (in browser), no other libraries, framework, build systems allowed.
2. think hard and divide the task into multiple stages, so that we can better handle the progress
3. feel free to raise any concerns until you fully understand what to do

### DoD
1. figure out what need to be done
2. divide them into concise tasks and stages
3. after all stages completed, we will have multiple pages (html files), including `main` (the current), `detail`, `search`, `about`. they will all work with mocked/placeholder data, but interactive and well-designed. They must fully align with our design.
4. the strcuture should be clear, easy to extend, and ready for backend integration.

#### main page
1. Featured Artworks -> thin, full width, small picture only line, no text is needed
2. the `Submit an Artwork` section on `main` page need to be removed
3. remove `Contact` from `Quick Links` (from all the pages)
4. the elements in `Quick Links` should be `About`, `Guidelines` and `Ethics` (in all the pages)
#### search page
1. the size (mainly width) of the artwork grid view elements are not fixed, if less than 3 elements listed, the size will be adjusted to fit full width. Please make them fixed to 1/3 of full width, just like normal 3 elements
#### about page
1. remove `Our Team` section
2. remove `Collaborate With Us` from `Get In Touch` section, remain `Contact Information` only
#### detail page
1. add a tiny, not eye-catching link called "Report" to the right of `Share Artwork` button (at the end of that line), after being clicked, a form will shown. In the form users can enter the basic report information if they believe the artwork is unacceptable.

---

#### main page
1. spread the elements in `Features Artworks`, use a format like `space-between`, to make them take the full width but in an elegant way.
2. remove `Map navigation help` and the suspecious blank below it
3. make the `Read More` button (and the whole `About the Atlas` element) click to jump to our `About Us` page
#### about page
1. refactor the `Get In Touch` section to make it beautiful and elegant. Current design looks weird.
#### detail page
1. adjust the position of `Report` button to the rightmost, fill the gap by space.
2. change `(3) Artist information (if known and publicly available)` to `(3) Artist information`
3. change `(4) Submission date and submitter's username (if non-anonymous)` to `(4) Artist name`, retain name only in the value shown

---

#### main page
1. adjust the map container, remove its bottom padding, the `.map-section` could be: `padding: var(--space-3xl) 0 0 0`.
2. make the `Read More`, `View Guidelines` and `Learn About Ethics` these three button to be at the same horizonal alignment (shown at the same height)
#### about page
1. can you make the elements in `Get In Touch` section to use the same component as the elements in `Our Values` section?
#### detail page
1. remove `p.image-caption` element from the page, we don't need it.

---

#### sensitive property of artworks
we need to add a new property to our "artwork"s, if they have `sensitive` (boolean), their detailed address will be hide and only an appx address will be kept.
##### map component
in map, the color of mark pin for `sensitive` artworks should be orange, and the address will generally be the only the state, rather than a detailed address with street number.

#### ethics, guidelines new page
since we have two buttons in the footer section along with our "About". Create two new pages for these two new topic, the new pages can be called `ethics` and `guidelines`, they have basically the similar content and similar design language with "About Us" page, but be much simplier. 

Only two sections are required for each. 

For example, the `ethics` page can have a `About Our Ethics` section which is the same with `About Indigenous Art Atlas` in "About Us" page, and `Our Ethics` section with further detailed introduction, quite similar to `Our Mission` in about page, but without the need for a picture.

The same to `guidelines` page.

Walk through the frontend only project, since it is HTML+JS+CSS only, so some files are quite big (near 1k lines).

Understand the project structure, think hard then fix the following issues:

1. fix login/auth management in register page. we have a mocked login/logout feature across multiple pages, for example in `about` page, but the `register` page is still lacking of this feature.
2. `account` (you can find it in `register` page) should be an individual page, so remove it from `register`, create a new page for it. And in the page we will show the information about the user, including all the submitted fields in register (except password).
3. in `register` page, add a new text input for password to the form.
4. `Artwork Information Submission Form` should only be in `account` page
    - if the user role is a `User` (select-able in register page), then only basic information (see point 2) is shown
    - if the user role is a `Artist`, in addition to the basic informaion, we also show the `Artwork Information Submission Form` button (which opens another page), and a list of all the artworks submitted by the user. We can find an example of artworks list in `search` page.
5. `If you are an already-registered artist, click this button to visit your artist page` this line (and the button after it) should be hidden for now, we may need it later, but not for now.
6. in `detail` page, the `<div class="image-carousel">` should be a carousel, but it has been broke by someone. We need the carousel, so fix it please.

---

1. in `artwork-submit` page, fix the login/logout management
2. the `Artwork Image (optional)` should be mandatory, and this should be a multiple file upload input, rather than a text field.
3. Remove `Review Queue`, `Category`, `Settings` from `index.html` (admin dashboard)
4. in `Artworks` sub-page in `index.html` admin dashboard, add a column for `Address` (which can be optional), add a column for `Artwork Image` (see point 2), can have mutliple pictures. 
5. the columns in `Users` sub-page in admin dashboard should keep consistent with `register` page, add `Nation / Language Group`, `Bio` columns.
6. the columns in `Reports` sub-page in admin dashboard should keep consistent with `Report Artwork` form in `detail` page, change the `Type` column to `Reason`, use the values from the form, and add a column for `email` (which should be optional). 

---

The `Artworks` sub-page in @index.html is broken, a detail panel cannot be shown by clicking the artwork name, but will always be at the right bottom position of the webpage, you need to scroll to find it.

Find an elegant and simple way to solve it. You can use playwright to check the status.

This project is a HTML+CSS+JS only project, so you can open html files directly in browser.

---

`Image and map preview placeholder (no external libs). Consider blurred map for sensitive sites.` is not a proper text for demonstration. Consider remove this section totally. 

The `Description` column is unproper, it should not be an editable text field. Use a static text instead

The `Guidelines` section in `dashboard` sub-page seems make no sense, remove it.
